# CO-time-series-forecasting

The goal is to predict future values of a time series of carbon monoxide measurements. The following models have been used:
- AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
- Unobserved components model (UCM)
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- Long short-term memory (LSTM)
- Gated recurrent unit (GRU)
